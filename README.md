oceanctl
========

Command-line interface to Digital Ocean's API.

Create the file: ~/.config/oceanctl and put your Digital Ocean API_KEY and CLIENT_ID in it like this:
API_KEY=yourkey
CLIENT_ID=yourid

(Work in progress. Currently only "read" operations implemented. No droplet creation, reboot, etc.)
